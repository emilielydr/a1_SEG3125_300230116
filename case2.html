            This interactive card matching game challenges the player's memory and concentration. Designed with cognitive psychology principles in mind, it aims to improve short-term memory and recognition speed through simple, repetitive play. The objective is to flip cards and find all matching pairs in the fewest possible moves.

            The interface uses a minimalist aesthetic to reduce distractions, making the game approachable for users of all ages. Typography choices reinforce usability—Quicksand is used for main headings and instructions to promote a friendly tone, while simpler fonts are applied to game statistics and buttons to ensure readability.

            The color palette and animations provide clear visual feedback for user actions. For example, flipping a card uses smooth transitions, and matched pairs stay revealed, providing both satisfaction and cognitive reinforcement.

            The game is responsive, accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, and includes a reset feature so players can replay easily. User experience is enhanced by:
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast-rich design for visual clarity</li>
                <li>Immediate visual feedback upon match/mismatch</li>
                <li>Compact layout optimized for performance and focus</li>
                <li>Low cognitive load navigation</li>
            </ul>

            This project demonstrates the application of design thinking, usability principles, and user-centered interaction models in a playful context.
